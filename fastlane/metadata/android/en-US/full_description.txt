<i>CaptureWave</i> is a voice and screen recorder app built with <a href="https://m3.material.io/">Material Design 3 (You)</a>.

It supports multiple audio formats and codecs, such as M4A, AAC and OPUS.

<i>CaptureWave</i> uses SAF (Storage Access Framework), thus it doesn't require any storage permissions.

The application is extremely lightweight, as it relies solely on the Android base and Material design libraries, without any additional dependencies.
